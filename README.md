# Thesis
Small repo containing most of the code written for bachelor thesis.
It contains code designed to show how key Recommender systems work, their metrics, plotting, various tests etc.
Except for educational motives the key task of this work was to build some kind of assessment system to test,
how well various Recommender Algorithms cope with their main task.
Unfortunately all text information had to be written in Ukrainian and I am not that much interested in manually translating it. There are few really interesting approaches that you may want to have a look it. Feel free to get in touch, if interested in collaboration.
